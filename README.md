# Iberians

*Work in progress*
*Feel free to contribute*

Iberians is a clone of the board game The Settlers of Catan.

The Settlers of Catan is a strategy game where players collect resources and use them to build roads, settlements and cities on their way to victory. The board itself is variable, making each game a little different from the next.
